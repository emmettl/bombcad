# Roadmap

Where the model is weakest, and what would be done about it. Each model document has its own
detailed list; this one puts them in order across the whole project.

## Standing of the project

BombCAD answers its original question: blast on simple structures can be simulated on a laptop
GPU at tens to a hundred times slower than real time, with physics that is verified against
theory. Against measurements it is close on one test (a slab) and too stiff on another (a
full-scale internal explosion). It is not validated for engineering decisions, and nothing in
it should be used to judge the safety of a real structure.

## Limitations, most important first

| # | Limitation                                                              | Consequence                                                   | Detail |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | The structural model has been compared with three tests, and springs back too far | On a slab test the peak converges to 105 mm against 108 measured; a beam bent to failure carries 97–99% of its measured moment; in a full-scale internal explosion, with the chamber's detailing modelled, the roof peaks at 38 mm against 87 mm in the test paper's own model, and its edge is left 7 mm up against 95 mm measured; on the finest mesh the answer has not converged | [Validation](validation.md#an-internal-explosion-in-a-reinforced-concrete-chamber) |
| 2 | Shear failure and joints are the least reliable predictions             | Breach, punching, direct shear and wall–slab joints are indicative only | [Concrete model](concrete-model.md#limitations) |
| 3 | The default gas has no afterburning and treats hot air as cold          | Incident impulse 13–22% low and rooms' gas half the design value, unless afterburning and hot air (2 times slower) are switched on | [Air-blast model](air-blast-model.md#hot-air) |
| 4 | Peak pressure is under-resolved near the charge                         | Close-in loading and spall are unreliable                     | [Air-blast model](air-blast-model.md#limitations) |
| 5 | Collapse and debris have never been compared with anything              | They look plausible; that is all                              | [Structural model](structural-model.md#limitations) |
| 6 | Moving solids are a staircase of whole cells                            | Wall positions are good to a cell; small fragments are crude  | [Structural model](structural-model.md#coupling-to-the-air) |
| 7 | One bonded body of up to eight materials, lattice-aligned geometry; debris pushed crudely by the air | Real buildings only roughly; thrown debris is approximate | [Structural model](structural-model.md#limitations) |
| 8 | The rebound after a slab's peak is too large; close-in concrete is unchecked | Rebound is too large; compaction is modelled, but its strength does not grow with pressure | [Concrete model](concrete-model.md#limitations) |
| 9 | The app's interface has not been reviewed by eye                        | Layout or interaction problems may exist                      | Below |

On the last point: the app's logic is covered by tests that drive its model without a window,
and its rendering is checked through offscreen snapshots, but its panels, text fields and file
dialogs were written without being seen on screen.

## Planned work

### Validation first

More evidence is worth more than more features. The sources each step needs, and what is
needed from them, are listed in [Data wanted](data-wanted.md).

1. **The chamber's joints.** In the test they were cut through within milliseconds and the
   roof was left 95 mm up; the model's stay whole, carry an arching thrust that outlasts the
   load, and bring the roof back to 7 mm. And the 25 mm mesh, on which the peak (65 mm) has
   not converged and the wall tops tear on the rebound. (Done: bars resisting sliding across
   cracks, and cracks bridged across a section, which took the roof from thrown to about
   100 mm; cracks that turn with the stress until they open; then the detailing itself, as
   inclined bars across the chamfers and mats and ties in the down-stand, with a time step
   that allows for the bars and contact that holds eight nodes a cell. With the detailing the
   roof is about twice as stiff as the paper's model: 38 mm against 87 mm. The diagonal bars'
   size and the down-stand's steel are assumptions; see
   [Validation](validation.md#an-internal-explosion-in-a-reinforced-concrete-chamber).)
2. **A third and fourth structural test**, chosen to differ from those so far: a slab with
   steel in both faces, a member that failed in shear, and a wall under an open-air charge. The
   high-strength slabs of the same contest are the obvious next case, since the geometry and
   loading are already set up; their data would have to come from Thiagarajan et al. (2015).
   (Done: a beam bent slowly to failure, Janney et al. (1956) via Xu and Lu (2016), whose
   peak moment the model gives within 3% on two meshes, with nothing fitted; it found
   splitting cracks along the bars softened over too wide a band, now fixed. See
   [Validation](validation.md#a-reinforced-beam-bent-to-failure).)

### Then the physics the evidence points to

3. **Charge model.** Close-in peaks are under-resolved: a mapped one-dimensional solution
   would help there; and dissociation and the products' own composition for the hottest gas.
   (Done: afterburning, limited by mixing and oxygen, and thermally perfect air, which together
   bring the closed-room gas pressure within 8% of UFC 3-340-02 and the incident impulse in the
   open within 6% of Kingery–Bulmash.)
4. **Shear in concrete.** A test of a member that failed in shear. (Done: cracks whose axes
   turn with the stress until the crack opens, by default, after the lattice planes were
   found to mishandle inclined cracks, and a second crack once the tension has turned more
   than 30° from fixed axes; see [Cracking](concrete-model.md#cracking).)
5. **The rebound.** The slab's mid-span hinge springs back twice as far as the specimen did on
   every mesh. (Done: compaction of the pores under very high confined pressure, after
   Holmquist, Johnson and Cook; unchecked against a close-in test.)
6. **Cut cells** between moving solids and the air. Moving walls already push the air (a
   piston test matches theory within 2%) and conserve the gas within 0.3%, so cut cells would
   now buy geometric precision only. Deferred.

### Then scale and scope

7. **Contact that knows the shells' thickness.** (Done: shells and solids together, tied
   through the thickness, three times faster than all solid elements on the single-storey
   building with only its front wall solid, and in contact with each other once anything has
   failed; see the [shell model](shell-model.md#shells-and-solids-together).)
8. **Joints within materials**: bearings that separate; masonry's joints on coarse elements
   and in shells, as strengths that differ across and along the bed joints. (Done: several
   materials in one body; joints between materials that open at the bond of mortar to
   concrete; structural steel and annealed glass, the glass as shells in panes; and masonry
   as units and mortar joints in running bond, which open at the bond and slide by friction,
   on solid elements no more than half a course high: see the
   [concrete model](concrete-model.md#masonry-as-units-and-mortar-joints).)
9. **Adaptive resolution in the air**: several levels. (Done: one finer level, by 2 or 4, in
   blocks of 4 × 4 × 4 cells that follow the shock, conservative across its edge, with its own
   outline of blocks and structure, loading a deformable structure from the fine cells beside
   its faces, and carrying afterburning's fuel and oxygen; refined by 2, a grid gives the peaks of one twice as
   fine three to five times faster in the open. See the
   [air-blast model](air-blast-model.md#refining-near-the-shock). A finely resolved
   one-dimensional start, tried first, gave exact records close to a charge but no lasting gain.)

Done from these lists: blast loads against the full Kingery–Bulmash curves; a coupled test
(the internal explosion); shell elements for walls and slabs and beam elements for columns (2
to 35 times faster coupled, see the [shell model](shell-model.md)); debris loaded by the air
(pressure gradient and drag on loose nodes, with the reaction given back to the air); still
air skipped, with an identical answer (1.6 to 1.7 times faster on the street scene, see
[Performance](performance.md#air-solver)); hollow concrete blockwork as a material; a
structure's largest deflection reported beside its deflection now; and layouts for a close-in
column, a wall in front of a building, a glass façade, a car park, an underpass and a
block-built house.

### Usability, in parallel

- Review the app on screen and fix what is found.

## Things tried and set aside

- **Fixes for the wrong cause.** A fine mesh of the validation slab collapsed, and nonlocal
  crushing, a stronger hourglass cap, a frozen compressive rate factor and wider crushing
  bands were each tried before tracing one element through the collapse found the two real
  errors (Poisson swelling counted as cracking; a missing normalisation in the compressive
  rate law). Nonlocal crushing and a reduced form of the hourglass cap were kept, the first
  switched off by default; the rest were removed. The lesson: trace a failing element before
  changing the model.

- **Fixed design factors for strain rate** (UFC 3-340-02): deliberately conservative; they
  predict 121 mm for the slab test against 108 mm measured. The strain-rate laws are the
  default; the factors remain available as an option.
- **A rotating-crack concrete model**: simple and robust, but with no shear transfer across
  cracks it cannot hold together a slab without steel through its thickness.
- **Tension softening scaled by element size in reinforced concrete**: dissipates a crack's
  energy in every row of elements and makes the answer depend on the mesh.
- **Contact between nodes that were once neighbours**: creates energy when the element between
  them fails in compression, and blew a wall apart.
- **Retrieving the Kingery–Bulmash polynomial coefficients and a second open structural data
  set** automatically: the sources found either refused automated access or re-used each
  specimen for several shots. The coefficients, the design manual and the chamber test were
  later supplied by hand.
